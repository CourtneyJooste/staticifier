# Staticifier 0.2
**THE** barebones static website template.
Based off https://github.com/carl-eis/staticifier

Staticifier is a basic template for static websites. No generation, no scss or templating engine; just good ol' bootstrap.

Now with hoganjs and gulp so forget the part about no generation...
